🚀 THE ROADMAP - WHAT IS COMING NEXT?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are constantly working on updates. Here is what we plan to add.
We need YOU to vote on what is most important!

[ ] Phase 1: Polish (DONE)
    - Basic Economy, Domains, Chest linking, Editor GUI.

[ ] Phase 2: Visuals & UX (PLANNED)
    - Custom Resource Pack support (Custom edit menus and items for player shops - like custom buttons).
    - Sound Effects (Clicking, Purchasing, Errors).
    - Better Chat formatting.

[ ] Phase 3: Management (FUTURE)
    - Transaction Logs (See who bought what).
    - Trusted Players (Allow friends to edit your shop).
    - Automation Tools (Autonomously buy items from other players' eshops and more).
    - Admin Tools
    - Dynamic Interactive Actions (Create fully functional 'websites' within Minecraft, extending beyond simple e-shops to include polls, news, and custom portals).

[ ] Phase 4: The Dream (LONG TERM)
    - Multi-Shop support per player.
    - Web Editor (Manage your shop from a browser).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
